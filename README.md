**TL,DR; Stuff is in branch `gh-pages`**

### Why is this empty ?

Public Github repos "master" branch are indexable (and indexed) by google: http://stackoverflow.com/questions/15844905/how-to-stop-google-indexing-my-github-repository

For confidentiality reason and avoiding duplicate content, the default branch of this repo was set to "gh-pages" and this one has been emptied.
